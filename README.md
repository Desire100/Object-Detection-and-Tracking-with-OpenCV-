# Object-Detection-and-Tracking-with-OpenCV-

# Goals
This repository will help you to understand a variety of object detection and tracking methods with help of opencv which is open source computer vison library.

## Template Matching
 Simply looking for an exact copy of an image in another image.
 
## Corner Detection 
  Looking for corners to find general edges of objects.
  
## Grid Detection 
Combinaing both concepts to find grids in images* useful for applications)

## Contour Detection 
Allows us to detect foreground vs background images, also allows for detection of external vs internal countours (e.g. grabbing the eyes and smile from a cartoon smile face).

## Feature Matching
More advances methods of detecting matching objects in another image, even if the target image is not shown exactly the same in the image we are searching.

## Watershed Algorithm
Advanced a;gorithm that allows us to segment images into foreground and background. also allows us to manually set seeds to choose segments of an image.

## Facial and Eye Detection
we'll use Haar Cascades to detect faces in images, not this not yet facial recognition.
